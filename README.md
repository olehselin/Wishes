## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd wish-list/wish-list/wish-list
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

The application requires two separate processes to run:

1. **Start the JSON Server** (backend API):
```bash
npm run server
```
This will start the JSON Server on `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Start the Development Server** (in a new terminal):
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173`

3. Open your browser and navigate to the development server URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the Vite development server
- `npm run server` - Start the JSON Server backend API
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build

## API Endpoints

The application uses JSON Server which provides RESTful API endpoints:

```typescript
interface Wish {
  id: string;
  image: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  createdAt?: string;
}
```
